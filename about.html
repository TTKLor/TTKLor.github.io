    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my page. My name is Katana Lor and I am currently working on getting my UX Design certificate. I lived in Minnesota for almost 8 years, before I 
      decided that I wanted to study at the University of Rhode Island. I majored and studied in Computer Science for two years before I withdrew. My nationality 
      is Hmong American, but I only speak english because I've never learned how to speak Hmong. </p>
      
    <p>I am looking forward on completing the certifcate for UX Design so I can start working and saving money. My goal in life is to have my own shelter and rescue,
      so I help stray animals. While living in Minnesota, I worked at an animal clinic and was able to work with the animals there. I had experienced new things that
      I never thought I would. The animals in the picture below are some of the few animals I have interacted with. </p>
