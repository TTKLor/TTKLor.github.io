    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Welcome to my page. My name is Katana Lor and I am a college student at the Unversity of Rhode Island.
      I was born in Rhode Island and lived in Rhode Island for 10 almost 11 years before I moved to Minnesota. 
      In Minnesota, I made friends with a lot of animals, since I worked at an animal clinic.</p>
      
    <p>I graduated from the Marshall High School during 2020. After 7, almost 8 years of living in Minnesota I moved back to Rhode Island during June of 2020.
      My nationality is Hmong American. I have a mom, dad, younger sister, younger brother, baby brother, and a baby sister. I also have a dog named Princess
      Glittersparkles, my baby sister picked her name. I have never really been interested in celebrities until April of 2020 when I found out about the group BTS.
      I also <strong>love</strong> snakes. I have been fascinated with snakes ever since I was young. After college, when I live alone, I plan on getting a 
      blue eyed leucistic ball python. </p>
