    <p>Welcome to my Apps page. My name is Katana Lor, I am currently a college student at the University of Rhode Island and this is my page that has my program.</p>
      <p> I have created an app along with my partner Julia Malyuta. We teamed up and made a game called Tic Connect 6 Toe. Our program mashup of Khan Academy's Tic Tac Toe, Khan Academy's Memory Game, and Connect 4.
        The basics of this game is to connect six X's or six O's. Whoever is the first to connect six is the winner. The starting page has the title of the game, my name along with Julia's, our bitmojis, and the "Start Game" button. <p>
